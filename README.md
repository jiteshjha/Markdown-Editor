# Markdown-Editor
Type your markdown into the box on the left and immediately see if on the box on the right. If you send a friend a link to this URL you both can edit the document at the same time!

This website uses the following to work:

    Showdown - Converts markdown text to beautiful HTML
    ShareJS - allows for realtime editing of this textbox
    Node.js - backend framework
    Redis - where we store our markdown documents
    Twitter Bootstrap - makes everything a little prettier
